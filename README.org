* Welcome!
  Quick and dirty CLI tool for retrieving a random salt, asking for
  your password, and hashing it.

  This tool requests a twenty character randomized string from
  https://random.org. It then asks you for your password, hashes it,
  and prints out the salt and the hash.

** Install
   =sudo cp pwhash /usr/local/bin=
   =sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pwhash=

** To use
   =pwhash=
